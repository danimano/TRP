=============== AP'PEAR ===============
=======================================

For Ap'Pear to work, the following packages need to be installed on your computer:
	- pearlib
	- tensorflow
	- matplotlib
	- pillow
	- webcolors

If you download Pear using pip ("pip3 install pearlib"), all those libraries will be installed at the same time if they are not already on your computer.

Ap'Pear requires your version of Python to be >= 3.0.
To launch it, enter the command:
	python3 main.py
